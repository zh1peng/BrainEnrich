# BioBrain: An R package correlating imaging-derived features with transcriptional profiles 🧠🧬

## Aim of the Toolbox 🎯

`braintranscript` is an R package designed to facilitate the correlation of imaging-derived phenotypes with transcriptional profiles. This toolbox aims to provide researchers and clinicians with robust statistical tools to uncover molecular architectures associated with cognitive functions, brain development, and disorders.

## Timeline of Development 🗓️

- **Q4 2023**: Initial conceptualization and development of core functions. 🛠️
- **Q1 2024**: Implementation of competitive null models and self-contained null models. 🧪
- **Q1 2024**: Testing with simulated datasets and refinement of statistical tests. 🔬
- **Q2 2024**: Beta release for community feedback and additional testing. 🔄
- **Q3 2024**: Incorporation of feedback and preparation for CRAN submission. ✍️
- **Q4 2024**: Submission to CRAN and publication of accompanying paper. 📰
