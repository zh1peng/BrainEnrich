\title{Sample Gene Sets Matching Co-Expression}
\usage{
sample_gs_matching_coexp(
  gs,
  coexp_matrix,
  tol = 0.01,
  max_iter = 1e+06,
  n_target = 5000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gs}{The target gene set for which similar co-expression profiles are sought.}

\item{coexp_matrix}{A co-expression matrix, typically calculated as the correlation matrix of gene expression data.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for the difference between the co-expression of the target and the sampled gene sets.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations to attempt finding matches.}

\item{n_target}{Number of gene sets to sample.}
}
\value{
A list of gene sets that closely match the target gene set's co-expression profile.
}
\description{
This function samples gene sets that closely match the co-expression profile of a target gene set.
The methodology implemented is informed by Wei et al. (2022) on statistical testing in transcriptomic-neuroimaging studies.

Assuming 'coexp_matrix' is predefined:
target_gene_set <- c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3")
similar_gene_sets <- sample_gs_matching_coexp(target_gene_set, coexp_matrix)
