\title{Calculate Brain Scores for Gene Sets (HPC version)}
\usage{
brainscore.hpc(
  job_id,
  n_perm_per_job = 1,
  perm_total,
  perm_id = NULL,
  output_dir = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{job_id}{An integer specifying the job ID in the Slurm array (e.g., 1 to 1000).}

\item{n_perm_per_job}{An integer specifying the number of permutations to handle per job.}

\item{perm_total}{An integer specifying the total number of jobs (equal to n_perm in brainscore function).}

\item{perm_id}{A matrix of permutation indices. This will be subset according to the job's assigned permutations.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string specifying the directory where the results should be saved. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the brainscore function, such as brain_data, gene_data, annoData, etc.}
}
\value{
A list containing the gene set scores for the specific permutations handled by this job.
}
\description{
This function calculates scores for gene sets based on brain data, designed for high-performance computing (HPC) environments where permutations are distributed across multiple jobs.
}
