\title{Convert Annotation Data to Pathway Table}
\usage{
Anno2Table(Anno_clusterProfiler_Env)
}
\arguments{
\item{Anno_clusterProfiler_Env}{An environment or list containing annotation data.
This environment is expected to contain pathway-to-gene (\code{path2gene}) and pathway-to-name
(\code{path2name}) mappings.}
}
\value{
A data frame with four columns:
\describe{
\item{pathID}{Pathway identifier}
\item{pathName}{Pathway name}
\item{geneSetSize}{Size of the gene set for each pathway}
\item{geneID}{Concatenated string of gene IDs for each pathway, separated by ";"}
}
}
\description{
This function takes an annotation environment, typically from \code{clusterProfiler},
and converts it into a pathway table. Each pathway will have its associated genes
concatenated into a single string, along with the pathway name and the size of the gene set.
}
